    <h1>Information About Me:</h1>
    <ul>
        <h2><li>CSU East Bay English Literature Graduate</li></h2>
            <p>Though I never worked in a related field, my background in English Literature
                gives me a great understanding of works of literature and also how to incorporate
                similar ideas into my own work. In other words, I would consider myself quite well spoken.
            </p>
        <h2><li>Enjoyer of Anime</li></h2>
            <p>At a glance this may seem like a minor interest without much value other than, of course,
                the joys of personality. However, my lifelong enjoyment of anime has developed into somewhat
                of an enjoyment of the Japanese language as a whole, which included me taking college courses
                in Japanese for two years. My ability to quickly pick up a foreign language can go along to show 
                that I am capable of picking up new things and develop thorough understandings that allow me 
                to succeed with any task.
            </p>
        <h2><li>Enjoyer of Video Games</li></h2>
            <p>
                This is what I would call my biggest hobby. This enjoyment is one of the main things that
                pushed me to aspire to become a web developer. Though these two things do greatly differ,
                I want to learn more about coding and possibly work on creating some simple games myself in 
                some of my free time.
            </p>
